# Customer-Segmentation-using-k-means-clustering

Using Mall customer dataset and performing K-Means clustering to segregate customers based on data in form of optimal clusters.

K Means Clustering Algorithm : 
1. Specify number of clusters K.
2. Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
3. Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing.

PROCESS :
1. Understanding the data
2. Performing Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters.
3. Training a model using unsupervised learning algorithm (K-Means)
4. Plotting the clusters.
